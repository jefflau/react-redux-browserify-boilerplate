# React/Redux Browserify Boilerplate

Uses: React, Redux Browserify, Babel (Babelify), BrowserSync, Stylus(+Rupture), Radium

A project I created to start new React projects using Browserify as a module system and Babel, which supports React (and ES6) out of the box and doesn't require the JSX Transformer. There are also build tasks for HTML/CSS(Stylus) and is hooked up to BrowserSync so you don't need to refresh your browser. It also has Radium installed so you can use inline styles


## Development

Install packages needed:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp
$ npm install
